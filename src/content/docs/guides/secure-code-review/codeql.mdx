## Introduction to CodeQL

**CodeQL** is a query language used for analyzing the security and quality of code. It allows developers to write queries that find potential vulnerabilities and performance issues in source code. CodeQL is extensively used in security research and secure coding practices, enabling the detection of common and complex vulnerabilities like SQL injection, buffer overflows, and more.

Using CodeQL to identify and resolve security issues early can significantly improve the security posture of applications and systems.
