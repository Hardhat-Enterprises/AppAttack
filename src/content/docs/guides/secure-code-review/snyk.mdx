## Introduction to Snyk

**Snyk** is a developer-first security platform designed to help organizations find, fix, and monitor vulnerabilities in their code, dependencies, containers, and infrastructure as code (IaC). It integrates seamlessly into the development process, enabling teams to identify security issues early in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) without disrupting productivity. By automating security checks and providing actionable insights, Snyk empowers developers to take ownership of security, ensuring that applications are secure from the start.
