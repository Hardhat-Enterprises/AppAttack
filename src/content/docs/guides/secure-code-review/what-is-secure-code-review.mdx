A secure code review is a process that involves a thorough examination of an application's source code to identify security vulnerabilities and ensure that the code adheres to the best practices for security. It is a critical step in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) aimed at producing more secure software by detecting bugs early on, which is more cost-effective than addressing security issues after deployment[1].

The review process involves both automated tools and manual inspection by experts who understand the application's context, its intended use, and the security implications of the code. Automated tools can help in crawling the code for known vulnerability patterns, but they often require human verification to assess the real risk and context of potential issues[1].

Secure code review techniques include:

- Ensuring coding guidelines and standards are followed[1].
- Using automated tools for code crawling to identify areas of interest, such as potential security implications[1].
- Manual inspection to understand the code's functionality and context[1].
- Identifying and analyzing areas of code that may have security implications, such as injection vulnerabilities[1].
- Utilizing methodologies like threat modeling to understand the application's threat landscape and focus the review on high-risk areas[1].

The OWASP Code Review Guide provides a comprehensive reference for conducting secure code reviews, covering various programming languages and technical controls, and offering practical examples and checklists[1]. It emphasizes the importance of integrating secure code review into the SDLC and using a risk-based approach to prioritize the review process[1].

Secure code review is not just about finding bugs; it also involves understanding the business logic, data flow, and security controls in place. It requires a combination of human expertise and technology support, as automated tools alone cannot fully grasp the context or the subtleties of business logic that might lead to security issues[1].

In summary, secure code review is a systematic examination of source code to identify security vulnerabilities, ensure adherence to security standards, and improve the overall security posture of an application. It is a collaborative process that involves both automated scanning and expert manual analysis to provide a comprehensive assessment of the code's security[1].
