## Introduction to Codeforces

**Codeforces** is a competitive programming platform that provides a range of coding challenges and contests designed to enhance problem-solving skills. Codeforces offers an excellent environment for honing general programming and algorithmic skills, which are foundational for secure coding practices.

Participating in Codeforces contests and solving problems can help developers improve their coding efficiency, problem-solving approach, and understanding of complex algorithmsâ€”all of which are valuable when implementing secure coding practices in real-world applications.
